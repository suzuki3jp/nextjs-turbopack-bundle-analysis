# Next.js Turbopack Bundle Analysis

A GitHub Action that analyzes Next.js Turbopack bundle size changes in pull requests and posts a comment with the results.

> **Note:** Inspired by [hashicorp/nextjs-bundle-analysis](https://github.com/hashicorp/nextjs-bundle-analysis) and designed to be compatible with it. If you are on webpack, use that project. If you are on Turbopack, this action is the alternative — it uses `next experimental-analyze` to report bundle size changes in pull requests.
>
> **Warning:** `next experimental-analyze` is an experimental Next.js feature. Its output format may change in future Next.js releases and could break this action.
>
> **Requires Next.js 16.1.0 or later.**

```yaml
# .github/workflows/bundle-analysis.yml

### Monorepo

For monorepos, set `build-output-directory` to the path of the `.next` directory relative to the repository root.

```yaml
- uses: suzuki3jp/nextjs-turbopack-bundle-analysis@v1
  with:
    build-output-directory: apps/web/.next
    build-command: pnpm --filter @myapp/web exec next experimental-analyze
```

## Example Comment

The action posts a comment like this on pull requests:

| Route    | Base (gzip) | PR (gzip)   | +/-       | %       |
| -------- | ----------- | ----------- | --------- | ------- |
| 🟢 /      | 100.00 kB   | 95.00 kB    | -5.00 kB  | -5.00%  |
